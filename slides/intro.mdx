<Notes>

</Notes>

---

## Why?

- Much safer code
- Higher quality code
- Self-documenting code
- Refactoring is easier and safer
- Better than PropTypes

<Notes>

- Safer: Catches errors/bugs faster, before code is run.
- Enhances code quality.
- Documentation inline! Self-documenting code.
    - Jump to definition
    - Can actually generate type documentation for react components (it's cool).
- Makes refactoring easier.
    - Typescript will tell you if you've broken some assumption in your code.
    - Much more confidence to refactor.
    - 9Press: Theme refactoring.
- React
    - Better than proptypes. Catches when you type, not when you run.
    - Autocomplete props.
- Couldn't live without it.
